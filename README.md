# MouseVG
MouseVG allows the user to track the pointer information across all screens and generates an SVG corresponding to the mouse path. <br/>
It provides a text-based UI and runs the tracking on a separate thread. <br/>
The <code>ResolutionConverter</code> is used to project the generated SVG to a target resolution. <br/>
The JAR output of the build should be run by the provided <code>Run.bat</code> batch file for Windows. <br/>
